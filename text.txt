follow me to teh main.cpp
how did you get the color in the terminal/console?



you push yourself when you are happy with your changes
it updates live to my computer's copy of the files, not github
now i can stage the files and push them and update instantly

not sure what you mean
If you want to work on it, you go to the git tab on the left colum, the one i have highlighted. Then you clone git repository from github, paste the link
and download teh files to your computer as a clone. Then when you make new files or edit these ones, you push it to github as a pull request, and i approve it


So when we update stuff live, does it automatically push to the github?
ohhhhhhhhhhhh okay so you could just do the uploading and it would work the same?
